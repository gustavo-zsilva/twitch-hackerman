#### <p align="center">Have you ever wanted to have a more deep look at some streamer's Twitch account and there wasn't a cool-looking website that did it?</p>

Me too. That's why I created twitchHackerman. It's a performatic website that gives you all the info that Twitch has, and also giving you a more complete UI than Twitch offers.

If you are hyped up I recommend checking it out [here](https://twitchhackerman.vercel.app).

> Simple Twitch API Searcher, with cool UI and made with NextJS.
